Google Glass Stopwatch (w/ compiled .apk !!!)
=========

Holy cow finally got this thing to work on an old Google Glass I found in dhash's room

## Getting started

Check out our documentation to learn how to get started on
https://developers.google.com/glass/gdk/index

## Running the sample on Glass

You can use your IDE to compile and install the sample or use
[`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html)
on the command line:

    $ adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk

This command is also found in the install.sh file

To start the sample, say "ok glass, start a stopwatch" from the Glass clock
screen or use the touch menu.
